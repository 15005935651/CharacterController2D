CharacterController2D
=====================

CharacterController2D is similar to the built-in Unity CharacterController compoent. It has a similar API (mainly a move method that takes a delta movement) and is a really good base to make a super solid controller using Unity's new 2D goodies.

A simple demo scene is included along with a few Spelunky sprites (which obviously should not be used in your game!).
